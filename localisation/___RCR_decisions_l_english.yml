 RCR_Vodka_Wars:0 "The Vodka Wars"
 RCR_Vodka_Wars_desc:0 "Historically, the sale of alcohol was a matter of national importance in both Tsarist Rethenia and Szlachta Psarska. The alcohol monopoly in Rethenia was maintained both after the fall of the monarchy and after the civil war. Marshal Drarzсowski's regime is supported by major vodka syndicates, the largest of which was awarded the right to export vodka under the honorary brand name Marszałkowa. Seeking to restore the economy, the Council Rethenian government expects to raise huge funds from abroad by selling the world-famous brand "Citadel" vodka. Both brands strive to dominate the world vodka market, and the winner in this struggle will get a source of significant income. \n\n§GMarszałkowa§! sales: §G[?PSR_vodka_sells]§! million mobiums. \n§RCitadel§! sales: §R[?RCR_vodka_sells]§! million mobiums. \n§YOther vodka brands'§! sales: §Y[?FREE_vodka_sells]§! million mobiums."

With these prison camps in place, we can make sure no plots or coups will occur. But a new question has arisen. What do we do with them? \n\nAs a fresh source of labour, we can easily get them to ‘volunteer’ for industrial projects. Building factories, infrastructure and other objects. Thus allowing them to give back to the state. \n\nBut we should also consider how we treat the prisoners themselves. If we reward them for cooperation through alleviated punishments, the number of prisoners who are willing and able to work will greatly increase. We can even consider releasing some of the reformed ones. Just to make sure that we have enough political support to continue using them. \n\n§GPrisoner workforce available:§! £manpower_icon!§Y[?RCR_prisoners]§!"

With the Robotnik invasion, all projects were cancelled, many scientists fled, and the institutes were destroyed. Now that the country has almost recovered from the scars of the war storm, the Council government has set a new goal: to revive national cosmonautics.

The latest data collection and processing systems, dispersed throughout the country, would change the nature of planning fundamentally. The artificial intelligence built into this system will be able to solve millions of optimization problems automatically. Implementing this project will be impossible without the genius of domestic science... And a huge effort, mobilizing many of our country's resources. To make a huge breakthrough in cybernetics and economics is not for everyone. The result should minimize the selfish interests of bureaucrats, put an end to the deficit, ensure optimal pricing, and finally eliminate the anarchy of production, in which Mobius has wallowed. \n\n§CMonthly project performance rate:  [?RCR_AUTO_GROW]%§!"
