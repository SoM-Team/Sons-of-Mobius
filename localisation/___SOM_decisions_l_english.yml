The Second Robotnik War was the clearest testimony of all the weaknesses of the Acorn absolute monarchy. Tired of the arbitrary rule of the king, many sectors of society saw in Elias' ascension to the throne not hope, but as the continuation of the nightmare. General Amadeus Prower rallied democratically minded officers and intellectuals around him. The Southern Baronies, devastated by war and unaided by the King, remember their rebellious past. The socialist unions in the Titanium Belt are organising a militia and preparing a general strike. If the right measures are not taken, the Kingdom of Acorn will very soon meet its end on the scaffold...\n\nLoyalty to £crown!§CElias Acorn§!: §C[?KOA.loyalty_elias]§!\n£rifles!§ORepublican§! political power: §O[?KOA.prower_power]§!\n£rabbit!§YConfederate§! political power: §Y[?KOA.baron_power]§!\n£red_star!§RSocialist§! political power: §R[?KOA.union_power]§!"

After the technocratic organization §R"Dark Legion"§! led by §RDimitri the Cyborg Echidna§! offered his assistance to §REggman§!, §Rthe doctor§! adopted new principles of government, settling new governments in the manner of the echidna organization.

Not all §RD.E.L.§! leaders can be considered conscientious enough despite their considerable influence and their service to our cause. §RThe Central D.E.L§! is shackled by internal conflicts in which the leading authority has been concentrated in hands of §RLien-Da the Echidna§!, loyal to the common cause but not devoid of far-reaching aspirations. §GThe Northamer D.E.L§! led by §GClove the Pronghorn§! is almost bogged down in the chaos of constant subversions and terrorist attacks managed by nationalist and socialist elements, supplied by Hibulia, Psarska and other regional powers. Concerned about the fate of her sister Cassia, §GClove§! relies on herself above all. At the edge of knife, §Ythe Great Desert D.E.L.§! is led by §YBeauregard Rabbot§! – an aristocratic exile of the Southern Baronies, who has relatives on the other side of the barricades and so is quite capable of conspiracy. §DThe Soumerican D.E.L.§!, though the most remote, seems the most stable, though headed by the unprincipled and brutal §DThunderbolt the Chinchilla§!."
