 mobiannews.2.d:0 "Robotnik's invading army was almost completely destroyed by the return of Sonic and the combined efforts of several outstanding Acorn commanders. For the first time the so-called "Eggman" was dealt a crushing military defeat by the regular Acorn army. Nevertheless, both sides of the conflict were left extremely exhausted: Robotnik's army, which had lost its fighting ability, needed renewal, and His Majesty's war-weary subjects were not ready for a victorious march deep into the Eggman Empire. A tacit cease-fire was negotiated - the parties agreed not to take aggressive action for the next 3 years."
