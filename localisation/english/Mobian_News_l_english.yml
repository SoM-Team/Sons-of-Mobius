mobiannews.2.d:0 "Robotnik's invading army was almost completely destroyed by the return of Sonic and the combined efforts of several outstanding Acorn commanders. For the first time the so-called "Eggman" was dealt a crushing military defeat by the regular Acorn army. Nevertheless, both sides of the conflict were left extremely exhausted: Robotnik's army, which had lost its fighting ability, needed renewal, and His Majesty's war-weary subjects were not ready for a victorious march deep into the Eggman Empire. A tacit cease-fire was negotiated - the parties agreed not to take aggressive action for the next 3 years."

mobiannews.401.t:0 "Incredible revelations"
mobiannews.401.d:0 "The discovery of an ancient but small digital archive lead to a breakthrough in ancient history! Turns out that Genghis Khan was the first known human to master Chaos Control, which allowed him to unite the tribes and lead a campaign of conquest, where he personally slayed over 40 million people. And later, the Spanish Inquisition managed to organize a large network of agents, who also used Chaos Control, to spread fear and doubt. Both examples are united by a "medieval" origin. But what are the "Middle Ages" and why "middle"? This is assumed to be due to the name given to the centre of civilization of the time: "Middle-Earth". During the period, Chaos Control's usage flourished - up to the creation of new species and the rapid evolution of nature. The most recent find however, is the most unique. The island nation 'Japan' was known for its extraordinary scientific growth. But, for reasons unknown, about fourteen and a half thousand years ago, Japan directed all its efforts to military development. After 150 years they moved from swords and forges to so called "battle mecha".
